My research interests include jets from both Young Stellar Objects and Active Galactic Nuclei, long baseline radio interferometry, radio polarimetry and scientific software development.\r\n\r\nA list of my publications from is available from the NASA ADS ordered by [date](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/abs_connect?author=Coughlan,+C.P.;Coughlan,+Colm.P.;Coughlan,+Colm.&aut_xct=YES&aut_syn=YES&return_req=no_params&sort=DATE) or by [citations](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/abs_connect?author=Coughlan,+C.P.;Coughlan,+Colm.P.;Coughlan,+Colm.&aut_xct=YES&aut_syn=YES&return_req=no_params&sort=CITATIONS).\r\n\r\nMany of these publications are also available on [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/find/astro-ph/1/au:+Coughlan_Colm/0/1/0/all/0/1').\r\n\r\nI received my PhD from University College Cork in 2014 under the supervision of Prof. Denise Gabuzda. My thesis, \"The development of new methods for high resolution radio astronomy imaging\", is available from the [UCC CORA archive](https://cora.ucc.ie/handle/10468/1924).\r\n\r\n# Outreach\r\n\r\nI regularly give public talks about astronomy and astrophysics at Dunsink Observatory. Part of the Dublin Instiute for Advanced Studies, Dunsink observatory has regular stargazing events, tours and public talks from members of the institute and visitors.\r\n\r\n# Software\r\n\r\nAs part of my research I often write software for use in radio astronomy and astrophysics. All of my software is available at GitHub, please contact me if you have any questions about downloading/installing/running it.",
